        <h3>Degree/Diploma Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          In order to receive a bachelor's degree in engineering at the University of Toronto, students
          must complete the undergraduate engineering program for their desired field. Completing courses
          includes receiving 50% or higher in all courses in their undergraduate program. To be eligible
          to graduate, students must have a weighted session average of at least 60%.
          Students must also not have gotten more than two marks within the 40%-49% range.
          Before graduation, engineering students must have also completed a minimum of 600
          hours of practical work.
        </p>
        <p>
          To receive a masters degree in engineering at the University of Toronto, students must complete nine
          graduate courses and meet the same grade expectations as in the bachelor’s degree. Six of the nine
          courses must be technical courses and five of the technical courses must be ECE (Electrical & Computer Engineering)
          courses.
        </p>
        <p>
          To receive a PhD in engineering, students must maintain an average GPA of A- with no grades below a B-.
          They must also meet the yearly requirements which include which courses to take, and must do progress
          review meetings, including the Qualifying Exam.
