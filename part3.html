        <h3>My Personal Vocation</h3>
        <p>
        A vocation is a strong feeling of suitability for a particular career or occupation.
        I feel suitable to this career and I believe that the job of engineering will fulfill
        the vocation that God has called me to do by helping the common good and the community.
        I believe that engineering will help the community to advance with technology and intelligence.
        Engineering will be able to help others to improve their lifestyles, health, happiness,
        and will also help with research to gather more information because engineers create all
        sorts of materials with the main purpose of helping others.
