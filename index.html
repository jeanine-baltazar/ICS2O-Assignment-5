        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          In general, engineers use scientific discoveries in order to create
          useful materials and technology for people to use, and benefit from.
          They link scientific and mathematical principles to create these materials
          which can also solve technical problems and make actions more efficient.
        </p>
        <h3>Required Education</h3>
        <p>
          In order to become an engineer, you must earn at least a bachelor's degree
          in engineering which majors in your branch of interest. For certain fields,
          a masters may be required to advance.
        </p>
        <h3>Future Possibilities</h3>
        <p>
          Engineering branches off into six main categories; chemical, civil, mechanical,
          electrical engineering, management, and geotechnical. These six categories also
          have many sub categories. Therefore, there are many different careers and future
          possibilities for a job in engineering. For example, some of the highest paying
          engineering jobs include petroleum engineering, aerospace engineering, materials
          engineering, electrical engineering and chemical engineering.

        <h3>My Personal Opinion</h3>
        <p>
          I would be interested in a career involving engineering.
          Firstly, I would be interested in engineering because my best and favourite subjects
          in school are math and science. I believe that pursuing a job in engineering would be
          very enjoyable for me because of my interest in these subjects. Secondly, I also
          enjoy discovering, and creating new things because of my curiosity, and creativity
          in the arts. I believe this would allow me to succeed in an engineering career because
          I would be able to use my creativity to find solutions to problems. Finally, I enjoy
          helping others and I wish to make a positive impact on the world. I believe that a
          job in engineering would allow me to do this because this jobâ€™s goal is to create
          new technology for others to use and benefit from.
